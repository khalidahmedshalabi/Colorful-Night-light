# Colorful-Night-light
This is a temperature-based night-light system. As soon as your room gets dark, the system starts working and turns lights on. The special thing about this system is that it adjusts the color of the lights to suit the temperature of the room. Color and lighting influence our psychological functioning.

> LIGHT reveals the glories of the external world and yet is the most glorious of them all. It gives beauty, reveals beauty and is itself most beautiful. It is the analyzer, the truth-teller and the exposer of shams, for it shows things as they are. - Edwin D. Babbitt, Principles of Light and Color
